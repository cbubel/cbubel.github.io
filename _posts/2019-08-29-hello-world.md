This is my personal website which I hope to keep up to date with things I've been working on, tutorials, random thoughts, and more.

I'm using Jekyll to generate this site, along with Pixyll as the theme. I'd like to write my own theme at some point, but I'd rather focus on adding content in the meantime.

That's all for now!
