This past January, I started my Master's degree in Computer Science through Georgia Tech. Having completed my undergraduate degree in December of 2016, it'd been a while since I last had to watch lectures, take notes, and manage assignments. In undergrad, I relied primarily on Google Drive for all of my notes and assignments, but I decided to try something different for my first graduate class.

I'm a proponent of technologies that give me control over my own data, which is why I love [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). At a very basic level, Obsidian is a Markdown editor that operates on local files. Additionally, it can also act as a sort of [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) by allowing files to be linked together to form connections between related information.

While I'm not yet using it in a full "slip box" style, it's still incredibly powerful for my use case, which is to take notes as I watch lecture videos. So far, it's been very performant and has made searching and navigating incredibly easy. It also has Vim keybindings built in, which is a huge bonus.

Obsidian itself is free, but you can pay a monthly subscription for encrypted syncing to keep things up to date across devices. Personally, I simply store my folder of notes in iCloud Drive, which effectively does the same thing.

Below, you can see how I'm currently managing the files for my class. All of the Markdown files for lecture nodes are stored in the _Module Notes_ folder.

We have our first test this week, so I created a new note to aggregate all the relevant content that's going to be on it. Here, you can see the links in action, both on the rendered Markdown in the note, as well as in the graph view with a visual of the connections. Creating a new link is as easy as typing:

```
[[2.6 - Mental Models and Representations]]
```

I'm really happy with this workflow so far, primarily because I love that it's just a set of Markdown files sitting locally on my machine (and syncing through iCloud). While the desktop app is great, there isn't currently a native mobile app, though it is being worked on. That said, because it's just Markdown, you can use essentially any text editor in the meantime.

There's also a great set of plugins, one of which does a decent job of extracting highlights from PDFs. I haven't fully committed to using it yet, simply because PDF highlighting is a little clunky at times, and I'm still trying to decide if I want to integrate those with [Readwise](https://readwise.io) instead.

Anyway, that's just a quick overview of how I've been managing my course materials this semester. I highly recommend trying Obsidian if you're looking for a simple way to create and manage your knowledge base.
