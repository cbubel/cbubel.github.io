<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    I graduated in December 2016 from the University of Delaware with an Honors Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
    During the Summer of 2016, I interned as a Software Engineer at Susquehanna International Group. I will be returning
    to SIG this Winter 2017 to continue my career as a Software Engineer.

    As an undergraduate, I held several positions throughout the years, ranging from Honors Freshmen advisor, Web Developer for
    the College of Engineering, Full Stack Developer for a local startup, and, finally, President of the University of Delaware
    Chapter for the Association for Computing Machinery.

    I've planned hackathons, led meetings, run workshops, and presented research posters. Now, I'm ready to start my career as
    a Software Engineer and see where it can lead me.
