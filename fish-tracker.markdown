This is a "live" map of the fish I've caught while fly fishing. To learn how I collect this data, check out my post: [Tracking Fly Fishing Catches with iOS Shortcuts]({% post_url 2021-03-16-ios-fish-tracker %}). As of 2021-03-18, this is showing mock data, as I haven't had the chance to use it in real life yet.
