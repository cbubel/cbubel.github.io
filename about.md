My name is **Chris Bubel** and I'm a **Software Engineer** at Susquehanna International Group, a **proprietary trading firm** just outside **Philadelphia**. I work on our pricing infrastructure, trader-facing desktop applications, full stack web services, and more.

I went to the **University of Delaware** where I graduated in 2016 with a degree in **Computer Science** with high honors, along with a minor in **Math**. I was also the president of our university's chapter of the **Association for Computing Machinery** (ACM), through which I planned meetups and a hackathon.

I'm proficient in **C#** and **JavaScript**, and I enjoy doing full stack development. I like to use pure JavaScript when possible, but I'm experienced with **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue** as well.

I like hiking, fly fishing, and playing squash.
