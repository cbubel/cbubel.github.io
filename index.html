            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I graduated in December 2016 from the University of Delaware with an Honors Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. During the Summer of 2016, I interned as a Software Engineer at Susquehanna International Group. I will be returning to SIG this Winter 2017 to continue my career as a Software Engineer.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an undergraduate, I held several positions throughout the years, ranging from Honors Freshmen advisor, Web Developer for the College of Engineering, Full Stack Developer for a local startup, and, finally, President of the University of Delaware Chapter for the Association for Computing Machinery.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've planned hackathons, led meetings, ran workshops, and presented research posters. Now, I'm ready to start my career as a Software Engineer and see what paths it can take me down.
            </p>

            <h3>Course Work</h3>
            <p>
                During my time as an undergraduate, I completed all of the fundamental Computer Science courses, including Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Databases, Networks, Parallel Programming, and Software Engineering. My favorites, however, were Compilers, Data Mining, and Web Application Security.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the notable projects from my time as an undergraduate include constructing a compiler for the Meggy Java language, building a roll-based access control Ruby on Rails blog, and creating a teaching assistant matching web application.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the Spring of 2016, I applied for and was accepted into the National Science Foundation's I-Corps Sites program through the Horn Program in Entrepreneurship at the University of Delaware. My project centered around an idea for a personal security device, existing through current wearable technologies.
            </p>

            <h3>Skills &amp; Interests</h3>
            <p>
                Much of my personal, academic, and professional work so far has been in full stack web development, but I'm always looking to learn new things. I am proficient in all the standard web technologies, such as HTML, CSS/Stylus, and JavaScript, including the latest ES2015 features.
            </p>

            <p>
                I recently created an <a href="https://github.com/cbubel/js-crash-course" target="_blank">ES2015 crash course</a> using Jasmine unit testing to teach the newest concepts.While I prefer to write pure JavaScript, I am well accustomed to the numerous JavaScript libraries, especially Angular 1, and I have learned to pick them up quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also have experience developing Node, Ruby on Rails, and ASP.NET web applications, using technologies like Firebase, MongoDB, and Redis, along with fundamental web principles regarding security, authentication, authorization, and caching.
            </p>

            <p>
                While much of my work has been web related, I am very much interested in higher level Computer Science concepts, such as Machine Learning and Data Mining.
