      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a <b>Software Engineer</b> at Susquehanna International Group, a <b>proprietary trading firm</b> just
        outside <b>Philadelphia</b>. I work on our pricing infrastructure, trader-facing desktop applications, and full
        stack web services, just to name a few. My current toolset includes <b>C#</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A typical day involves writing fast code, solving time-sensitive trading issues, and improving
        the performance and scalability of our data sets. I regularly collaborate with traders, quants, and research
        analysts, and have recently been an <b>intern manager</b> and <b>mentor</b> for new hires.
      </p>

      <p>
        I went to the University of Delaware where I graduated in 2016 with a degree in <b>Computer Science</b>
        with <b>high honors</b>, along with a minor in <b>Mathematics</b>. I was also the <b>president</b> of our
        university’s chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), through which I planned meetups and a
        hackathon.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy hiking, fly fishing, and playing squash.

        <h3>Monthly PnL</h3>

        </div>

        <p>
          Monthly PnL is a <b>React PWA</b> I'm actively working on to help me gain insight into my spending on a
          monthly basis. Using <b>Firebase</b> as the backing store, the app allows you to enter recurring and one-time
          payments which are then summarized in a simple view. It's an intentionally manual process, as opposed to
          connecting with bank APIs, as I want to be cognizant of how much I spend. For the time being, it can be found
          <a href="https://income-tracker-991e9.firebaseapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <p>
          A lot of times at work, people will come up to my desk asking about a new feature, or wondering how something
          should be configured, or letting me know that a trader is having a weird issue, etc., all within the span of
          an hour. It can be really easy to get sidetracked when this happens, so I wanted to create a super simple
          nested to-do list to help keep track of what I'm working on. It's written in pure <b>JavaScript</b> and
          stores
          all the information in <b>localStorage</b>. The code makes heavy use of ES2015 classes, and still has some
          bugs to be
          worked out. It's a bit complex, and definitely makes me appreciate all that React does, but I like to see how
          far I can get without any libraries. It's published at <a href="http://workload.app"

        <p>
          For our Advanced Software Engineering class, my group created a <a
            href="https://github.com/cbubel/CISC475-Project-Website" target="_blank">web app</a> using <b>Angular</b>
          for
          managing and matching teaching/lab assistants to courses. Our app simplified the process for our professor,
          which
          was previously accomplished by manually maintaining spreadsheets. I contributed significantly to this project,
          as I had the most Angular experience, and the resulting application was very well received by our professor.

        <p>
          <a href="http://csbubel.com/intersparser/" target="_blank">Intersparser</a> is a utility I wrote in pure
          <b>JavaScript</b> to intersperse a stylized message into text. There
          isn't much to it, other than it being a fun way to practice my JavaScript skills. Maintained <a

        <p>
          I made <a href="https://github.com/cbubel/js-crash-course" target="_blank">this course</a> while at school as
          a way to learn <b>ES2015</b> constructs for myself and to teach others. The
          objective is to fix the code using ES2015 features and to get the <b>Jasmine</b> tests to pass.
